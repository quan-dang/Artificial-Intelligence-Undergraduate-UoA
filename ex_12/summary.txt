# Explanation of modified points (required)
I completed 3 tasks in the TO-DO list the the result was the same as in the answer.
+ TO-DO 1: I wrote unipolar sigmoid function (lambda = 1).
+ TO-DO 2: I created a function to calculate the inner product.
+ TO-DO 3: I calculated the error of the output layer for backpropagation.
+ TO-DO 4: I updated weight based on backpropagation.
