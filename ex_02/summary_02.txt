# Explanation of modified points (required)
The TO-DO list in func.c consists of 6 items in total. I completed all of them and ran "make test". The result was the same as in the file answer_02.txt.

# Discussion (if needed)
I revised bfs and dfs search algorithms. The exercises are very useful for me.

# Comments (if needed)
The README.md should have an English version.
